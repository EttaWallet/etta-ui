On linking RN packages: This worked for react-native-safe-area-context and react-native-svg:
https://github.com/storybookjs/react-native/issues/422#issuecomment-1414378449
- Install react-native-safe-area-context and react-native-svg with yarn: yarn add react-native-safe-area-context react-native-svg
- run expo run:ios then cancel. This installs Pods and links packages
- run expo run:android then cancel.
- At this point, if you run yarn start, you might have an error: Invariant Violation: Tried to register two views with the same name RNCSafeAreaProvider
- Remove react-native-safe-area-context: yarn remove react-native-safe-area-context
- run yarn start -c.
